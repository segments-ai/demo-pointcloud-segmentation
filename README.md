# Fast Point Cloud Segmentation with Model Predictions

This repository contains the notebook and model for fast point cloud segmentation with model predictions.
The notebook shows how you can set up model-assisted labeling on [Segments.ai](https://segments.ai?utm_source=guide&utm_medium=colab&utm_campaign=mal-pc-seg) using its simple Python SDK. As an example, a set of diverse frames of the SemanticKITTI dataset are labeled by using model predictions from [SqueezeSegV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01803).

A write-up of this notebook with additional information on how to set up model-assisted labeling for cuboid annotation can be found at [segments.ai/blog/fast-point-cloud-labeling-with-model-predictions](https://segments.ai/blog/fast-point-cloud-labeling-with-model-predictions)
